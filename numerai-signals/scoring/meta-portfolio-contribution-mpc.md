# Meta Portfolio Contribution (MPC)

With the invention of [Alpha](alpha.md), Signals also needed a metric that is similar to MMC, but uses the same neutralizers matrix and sample weights vector that Alpha uses. An analog to the Meta Model could be the Stake-Weighted Portfolio (**SWP**). In this case, Meta Portfolio Contribution evaluates the extent to which a signal enhances the Alpha of the SWP.

To find an individual userâ€™s contribution, we could then increase their stake in the SWP slightly and measure the change in Alpha of the SWP. This is basically just a gradient of SWP Alpha with respect to a users stake.

Given the following data:

* signals matrix _**S**_ (NaNs filled w/ 0.5)
* stake-weights _**p**_
* neutralization matrix _**N**_
* weight vector _**v**_

We generate neutral weights per signal:

```
s` = normalize(rank(s))^1.5
neutral_preds = s` - (N @ (N.T @ (v * s`)))
neutral_weights = neutral_preds * v
```

Next, stake-weight-average them into the **SWP** and normalize total weight:

```
SWP = (p * user_stakes).sum()
SWP = SWP - SWP.mean()
SWP = SWP / sum(abs(SWP))
```

Then, we can calculate the Alpha of the SWP:

```
SWP_Alpha = SWP * target
```

Finally, MPC is the gradient of SWP Alpha with respect to stakes:

```
MPC = gradient(SWP_Alpha, p)
```

When paid on MPC, data scientists will be incentivized to stake on signals that push the Numerai Signals tournament to be valuable to the Numerai hedge fund.
