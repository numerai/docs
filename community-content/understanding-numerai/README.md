# Understanding Numerai

_This section was last updated March 26, 2021_

Welcome to _**Understanding Numerai**_ 

This section is primarily aimed at getting new users up to speed and providing answers and clarity for all the common questions and confusions. 

However, many experienced users have often missed certain interesting details about how things work that they didn't even know they didn't know.  So even if you are a well-established user, you may want to at least scan over the \[soon to exist\] FAQ here just out of curiosity.

### **Table of Contents**

* [The Structure of Numerai](numerai-structure.md)  _&lt;-Click here! Available Now!_  A high-level overview of what Numerai is all about and how it works.
* The Data & the Models \[ coming soon \] A detailed explanation of the structure of the Numerai data set, what is expected of your models, and how they are scored.
* Super FAQ  \[ coming soon \] One-stop shopping for every detail you're wondering about. Every darn question that ever gets asked around here can probably found here. 

Newbies should consult the above listed pages in order as they build on each other.



### About this section

_Understanding Numerai_ section is part of the community-created documentation, and is being developed primarily \(for now\) by Numerai participant **wigglemuse** \(that's me!\) It is very much a work-in-progress and will be expanded and edited often in the coming days and weeks.  

Anything found here and in the \(coming\) sub-pages is believed to be correct, but is written by me, not the official Numerai team of which I am not a member. Although I mainly intend to just factually explain stuff, at times I may veer into what might be considered opinion or speculation on the future. So remember...this is all unofficial, I'm just a participant like you, and I have no inside knowledge about anything.  

I take requests!  Right now there is not much content here, but once I fill it out somewhat if there is anything that you feel is missing that you have a question about, or just anything I haven't covered that you think should be covered here, explained better, etc, please tag me or direct message on RocketChat. And if there is something you think I've got wrong, same thing -- tag me or get in touch on RocketChat.  

_**A note on errors:** remember I am not part of the team, this is "unofficial" documentation, and I'm going to be editing it heavily and often for the time being. Therefore, while I certainly appreciate anybody pointing out errors or typos in this section, I have no ability to give out bounties for that._
